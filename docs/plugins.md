# Writing plugins and services

There is little difference in writing a plugin or a service.

## Accessing Model Related Data

The datamodel classes are located in the gaphor.UML module. Data objects
can be accessed through the ElementFactory. This is a special class for
creating and managing data objects. Items can be queried using this
element factory. It's registered in the application as
element_factory. When writing a service or plugin the element factory
can be injected into the service like this:

```Python
class MyThing:
    def do_something(self):
        element_factory = Application.get_service('element_factory')
        items = element_factory.select()
```

``` note:: In the console window services can be retrieved by using the service() function. E.g.: ef = service('element_factory')
```

## Querying the Data Model

Two methods are used for querying:

-   select(query=None) -> returns an iterator
-   lselect(query=None) -> returns a list

query is a lambda function with the element as parameter. E.g.:

    element_factory.select(lambda e: e.isKindOf(UML.Class))

will fetch all Class instances from the element factory.

## Traversing Data Instances

Once some classes are obtained It's common to traverse through a few
related objects in order to obtain the required information. For
example: to iterate through all parameters related to class'
operations, one can write:

```Python
for o in classes.ownedOperation:
    for p in o.ownedParameter:
        do_something(p)
```

Using the `[:]` operator items can be traversed more easily:

```Python
for o in classes.ownedOperation\[:\].ownedParameter:
    do_something(p)
```

It's also possible to provide a query as part of the selection:

```Python
for o in classes.ownedOperation['it.returnParameter'].ownedParameter:
    do_something(p)
```

The variable `it` in the query refers to the evaluated object (in this
case all operations with a return parameter are taken into account).
